**Real-Time Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic Using Machine Learning**

---

## 🛡️ Overview

This project implements a real-time network traffic anomaly detection system to identify suspicious or malicious activity using machine learning algorithms such as **Isolation Forest**, **LSTM Autoencoders**, and **Self-supervised models**. The system captures IP traffic, preprocesses it, detects anomalies, and displays results on an interactive dashboard.
